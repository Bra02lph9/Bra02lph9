## 🧠 About Me

I’m a **self-taught developer and data enthusiast** with a passion for building practical, meaningful projects. I continuously evolve by learning new technologies, experimenting with AI/ML, and developing full-stack applications.  

I specialize in **Python for Data Analysis**, **web development** with React and Flask, and **modern software engineering practices**. Recently, I have:  

- Built a **Flask-based sentiment analysis app** for movie reviews using NLP and ML, deployed on **Render**  
- Developed a **React + MongoDB task manager app** (**Clean-Track**) with JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing, interactive dashboards, and deployed on **Vercel**  
- Integrated **Cloudinary** for media storage and optimization in projects  
- Learned **Django basics** and full-stack development concepts  
- Mastered **folder structuring, VS Code project management, and Git workflows** for professional coding  

🎯 **Learning Focus:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), Data Analysis, APIs, Git & GitHub  
📊 **Interests:** Data Visualization, Interactive Dashboards, Clean Code Practices  
🤖 **Exploring:** AI & Machine Learning (custom NLP models), Cybersecurity fundamentals  
🎂 **Fun Fact:** I also trained in pâtisserie — creativity flows from code to cakes!
